Let's tidy up any small things



Write a really nice README on what it does, how it does and how can one use it



Make it ready for release (will push to pypi)





Make a GitHub action for this actually, so I don't have to do this manually



There's already a pkg on pypi named "nanotorch", so we might need to name it something else
